# **Drowsiness Detection Model**


## Overview

This project is a drowsiness detection system developed to alert drivers when signs of drowsiness are observed. The system leverages PyTorch, YOLOv8, OpenCV, Haar Cascade, and Pygame. 

## Features

- Real-time Video Stream Analysis

- Full Face Detection and Analysis using YOLOv8 and Haar Cascade.

- Drowsiness Metrics: Eye Closure, Head Tilting, Yawning
   
- Auditory Alert System using Pygame.
